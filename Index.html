    <h1><b>Internet Protocols and IP Address</b></h1>

    <p>
        <b>Internet Protocols (IP)</b> are a set of rules that govern how data is sent and received over a network.
        The main <b>functions</b> of IP include addressing, packetization, routing, and fragmentation.
        These protocols make it possible for devices to communicate effectively across networks.
        Examples of protocols include <b>HTTP</b>, <b>HTTPS</b>, <b>FTP</b>, <b>TCP/IP</b>, and <b>SMTP</b>.
    </p>

    <h2><b>Types and Versions of IP Addresses</b></h2>

    <p>
        <b>IP addresses</b> are unique numbers assigned to devices on a network to identify and locate them.
        There are <b>two main versions</b> of IP addresses: <b>IPv4</b> and <b>IPv6</b>.
        <b>IPv4</b> is the older format (e.g., 192.168.0.1), while <b>IPv6</b> provides a much larger address space (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334).
        The <b>differences</b> between them include address length, format, and scalability.
        In <b>real-world applications</b>, IPv4 is still widely used, but IPv6 is being adopted to meet future demands.
